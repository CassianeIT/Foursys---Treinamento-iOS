## Exercise: If Statement Practice
 
 Come to grips with the if statement by rewriting the following comments in code form.
 */
let a = 60
let b = 76
let c = 60

if a == c {
   print("a and c are the same")
}

if a < b {
    print ("b is ahead of a")
}

if b > a {
    print ("a is not winning against b")
}

if a <= b {
   print("a is either losing to or tied with c")
}

// Se a for igual a c, print "a e c sao iguais"
// If a is equal to c, print "a and c are the same"

// Se a é menor que b, print "b esta a frente de a"
// If a is less than b, print "b is ahead of a"

// Se b for maior que a, print "a nao esta ganhando contra b"
// If b is greater than a, print "a is not winning against b"

// Se a é menor ou igual a c, print ä esta perdendo ou empatado com c"
// If a is less than or equal to c, print "a is either losing to or tied with c"

 - callout(Exercise): Add code after each comment above to follow the instructions. (For the greater than and less than operators, remember the rule about the hungry mouth.)
